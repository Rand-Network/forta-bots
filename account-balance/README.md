# Account Balance Agent Template

This agent monitors the account balances (in Ether) of addresses on the blockchain and creates an alert when
the balance falls below a specified threshold value. Threshold, alert type, and alert severity are specified
per address. An existing agent of this type may be modified to add/remove/update addresses in the agent
configuration file.
